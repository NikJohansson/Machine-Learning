# Machine-Learning
Some of my assignments from the course Applied Machine Learning (EDAN95) at LTH. These were all made in Python. These assignments include CNN, RNN, Bayesian classifiers, Expectation Maximization for Gaussian Mixture Models, Reinforcement Learning, Keras/TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
